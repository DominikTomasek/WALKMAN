# Walkman 
Is simple walking robot based on ardunio board. Perfect little project for start with aurduino or if you want build some kind of robot.
So there are compoments which I used for this robot :

1.arduino uno - which works here as mind of this robot 

2.homemade shield mark1 -on this litlle pcb you connects all parts together

3.four servomotors - they are here for legs and movement of robot 

4.two rgb leds - bcs rgb are cool   

5.ir sensor - serves here as eyes for stop 

6.wires - conection between board and other parts 

7.pla body print on 3d printer 

8.pla legs print also on 3d printer 

In this project you will learn how to work compoments which I named.
To be presaisly stuff like  setting servomotors on right angle, set right distance for your IR- sensor, making your own set of color from rgb diodes and other stuff.
